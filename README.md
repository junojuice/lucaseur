- 👋 Hi, I’m @lucaseur
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, of course. Specially games and websites.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to make a full website that actually works.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything I could help or get help with.
- 📫 How to reach me: I have a Tumblr — endoskesys. I am planning on making a individual blog for coding too.
